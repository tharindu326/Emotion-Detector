# Emotion-Detector
This aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into some classes, using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) 
with 2D convolution layer which creates a convolution kernel that is convolved with the layer input to produce a tensor 
of outputs. The training network is implemented on Keras and so far it is trained on six set of emotions, 
[angry, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised]. The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset which consists 
of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images.
